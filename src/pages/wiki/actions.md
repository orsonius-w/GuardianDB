In _Guardian_, every **Summon** has access to two types of actions per turn:

- **Full Action**

- **Movement Action**

These actions form the foundation of what Summons can do during your turn. Understanding how actions are used, lost, or regained is crucial to mastering positioning, offense, and defense.

üéØ Action Types
üî¥ Full Actions
Full actions are used for impactful abilities and interactions, including:

Attacking

Casting a Summon Spell (a spell that belongs to the Summon)

Using an activated ability that requires the [A] symbol

Executing a Movement Ability (distinct from regular movement)

Note: Even if a Summon has multiple Full Actions (via effects), it cannot attack more than once per turn, unless explicitly allowed.

üîµ Movement Actions
Movement actions allow a Summon to move on the board. Unless otherwise stated, each Summon can only move once per turn.

üí† Depletion & Reactivation
Whenever a Summon performs an action, it spends that action. When it has spent both its Full and Movement action, it is said to be Depleted.

Depletion means:
The Summon has no remaining actions this turn.

The Summon becomes Deactivated at the end of the turn.

Reactivation
During your Active Phase, all your Deactivated Summons automatically Reactivate, regaining both action types (Full and Movement). This happens unless prevented by an effect like Freeze.

‚ùÑÔ∏è Freeze & Forced Deactivation
Certain abilities, like Freeze, can forcefully Deactivate a Summon early by Depleting its actions outside the normal flow.

Freeze:

Immediately Depletes the Summon.

Prevents Reactivation in the following Active Phase. Instead, the Freeze effect simply ends.

Frozen Summons cannot move, attack, or use any actions.

Cannot counterattack while Frozen.

Forced Deactivation:

Any effect that Depletes a Summon outside of its own actions is considered a forced Deactivation.

Deactivated Summons from forced effects can still counterattack and move, unless otherwise restricted.

üîÅ Reactivating Mid-Turn
Some cards may allow a Summon to Reactivate during the turn ‚Äî for example, through spells or abilities that grant extra value.

When this happens:

The Summon regains its Full and/or Movement Action (depending on effect).

However, it still cannot:

Attack more than once per turn.

Move more than once per turn.

What can a reactivated Summon do?
Everything else ‚Äî such as:

Use a different activated [A] ability

Cast another Summon Spell (if it can afford the cost)

Use a Movement Ability (as long as it doesn‚Äôt count as basic movement)

üîÑ Example
You control a Summon with this ability:
[A]: Target Summon gets +1A until the end of turn.

Turn 1: It uses this ability (spending its Full Action).

Later that turn: You use a spell that Reactivates it.

Now: It cannot attack again this turn (if it already attacked), but it can use that [A] ability again or cast a Summon Spell.
