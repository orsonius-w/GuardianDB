**Guardian** is a strategic, grid-based trading card game for 2 or more players, where each duelist commands a powerful Guardian, summons mystical creatures, casts spells, alters the terrain of the battlefield, and unlocks alchemical secrets through complex card combinations.

Victory is earned through tactical movement, clever resource management, and mastery over the game’s many card types and interactions. Whether you dominate through overwhelming force, outmaneuver your opponent with traps and terrain, or unlock a powerful alternate win condition, every match offers endless variation and strategic depth.

Guardian supports 1v1, multiplayer free-for-all, or team-based formats. The game is easy to learn, but difficult to master—built for players who enjoy deep systems, emergent gameplay, and creative deckbuilding.

## How to Win

You win a game of Guardian by fulfilling any one of the following conditions:

1. **Reduce your opponent’s Guardian to 0 Life.** (Each Guardian starts at 15 Life.)
2. **Outlast your opponent’s deck.** If a player must draw a card but their deck is empty, they lose the game.
3. **Meet an alternate win condition.** Some cards have printed effects that cause you to win the game instantly if their specific conditions are fulfilled.
