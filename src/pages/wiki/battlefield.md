**The battlefield is a shared grid of 30 spaces, arranged in 6 rows of 5 columns:**

![Guardian Playmatt](/images/Playmattfull_sm.jpg)

- Each player controls the back 3 rows on their side.

- The center columns of each Guardian Zone are where Guardians are placed.

- Summons can move freely across the board once summoned — even onto your opponent’s side.

### Additional Zones (placed off-grid):

Each player also has:

Trap Zone – Where face-down Traps are placed.

Building Zone – Where Buildings are played.

Worker Zone – Where Workers are placed for energy generation.

Treasure Chest Zone – Stores your 5-card Treasure Chest.

Alchemy Deck Zone (optional) – Stores your Alchemy cards.

Graveyard – Where used cards are sent.
