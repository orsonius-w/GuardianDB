Before starting a game of Guardian, make sure you have all the necessary components. Here's a breakdown of what each player needs, along with shared components used during gameplay.

## Main Deck

Each player must bring a **Main Deck** containing at **least 55 cards**. This is the core of your strategy and includes:

- **Summons** – Units you place on the grid and use for combat or support.

- **Spells** – Instant or ongoing magical effects.

- **Traps** – Hidden cards that activate when triggered.

- **Items** – Equipment and artifacts with lasting effects.

- **Buildings** – Structures with health that can be attacked and destroyed.

- **Terrains** – Cards that modify the game board and battlefield conditions.

- **Events** – Semi-permanent, orientation-based cards that affect players each turn.

- **Workers** – Your main resource engine, used to generate energy.

There is no upper limit to your Main Deck size, but consistency is crucial — larger decks are harder to draw from reliably.

## Treasure Chest (5 Cards)

Each player brings a **Treasure Chest**, a special 5-card side pool accessible only during gameplay through card effects. The rules for deck construction are:

- **At least 4 cards must be Treasure cards.**

- The 5th card may be either a Treasure card or a standard card from your main deck pool.

- Treasure cards cannot be included in the Main Deck and can only be accessed via specific effects.

Treasure cards are usually **powerful**, **one-time-use** effects or unique units/items, and can have subtypes such as _Treasure Summons_, _Treasure Items_, etc.

## Optional: Alchemy Deck

The **Alchemy Deck** is an extra deck, separate from the Main Deck, consisting of **Alchemy cards**:

- Always have the Alchemy supertype.

- Always double as a Summon or Item card.

- Cannot be drawn or held in hand.

- Are accessed by combining Ingredients and Materials on the battlefield using specific "Combine" cards.

Each Alchemy card has a gear value in the top-right corner. The total cost of the combined components must match the Alchemy card’s gear value.

## Guardian Card

Each player selects a **Guardian Card** at the start of the game:

- You can only have **one Guardian**.

- It is placed in the Guardian Zone (on the board) and never enters your hand, deck, or discard pile.

- Your Guardian has 15 Life by default and often includes powerful abilities or passive effects that shape your playstyle.

Guardians are central to both your identity and win condition — if yours reaches 0 Life, you lose.

## Board and Zones

The game board consists of a grid of 30 spaces (5 columns x 6 rows):

- Rows 1–3: Your side of the field

- Rows 4–6: Your opponent’s side

Each player has the following zones:

- Guardian Zone (back row, central column)

- Battle Zones (two rows in front of the Guardian Zone)

- Trap Zone

- Building Zone

- Worker Zone

- Discard Pile

- Treasure Chest (off-board)

- Alchemy Deck (if used, off-board)

## Counters, Tokens, and Markers

You may need various tokens, counters, or dice to track:

- Damage

- Energy

- Status ailments (Freeze, Poison, etc.)

- Ongoing card effects

You can use dice, glass beads, or custom tokens.

### Optional but Useful:

Pen and paper or a life tracker to monitor Guardian Life.

Sleeves to separate deck types (especially Treasure and Alchemy).
