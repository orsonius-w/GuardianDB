Before starting a game of Guardian, make sure you have all the necessary components. Here's a breakdown of what each player needs, along with shared components used during gameplay.

## Main Deck

Each player must bring a **Main Deck** containing at **least 55 cards**. This is the core of your strategy and includes:

- Summons – Units you place on the grid and use for combat or support.

- Spells – Instant or ongoing magical effects.

- Traps – Hidden cards that activate when triggered.

- Items – Equipment and artifacts with lasting effects.

- Buildings – Structures with health that can be attacked and destroyed.

- Terrains – Cards that modify the game board and battlefield conditions.

- Events – Semi-permanent, orientation-based cards that affect players each turn.

- Workers – Your main resource engine, used to generate energy.
